# Stock-Analysis - VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to help Scott determine his returns on 12 different stocks in the years 2017-2018. We could have performed this analysis manually but are using VBA to automate the reporting and calculation processes to decrease the the chance of errors and reduce the amount of time needed to run the analysis.

## Results

![VBA Challenge 2017](https://github.com/boborodono/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png)

- Scott had a profitable 2017 with 11 of the 12 stocks posting a positive return. Some of the stocks doubled in value and DQ almost tripled in value!

![VBA Challenge 2018](https://github.com/boborodono/stock-analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

- 2018 was a tumultuous year for Scott's portfolio. Only 2 of the 12 stocks posted a positive return for the year. Some of the stocks such as DQ, JKS, and SPWR fell precipitously over the course of the year and subsequently wiped out most of Scott's gains for 2017. Good uck in 2019!

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

- Refactoring code will often happen when you need to use someone else's code to perform an analysis. Refactoring can be advantageous because as long as the original code functioned properly the framework is already provided and can act as a roadmap to tool the code for your own purposes. This can save time and energy.

- The disadvantages of refactoring code are that not every coder writes their code the same way and without clear comments and proper use of whitespace... the code may be difficult to decipher/understand and therefore may actually make it more troublesome when trying to refactor. This could lead to initial code errors and more time spent trying to debug when it may have been less time consuming and energy intensive to write the code from scratch.
